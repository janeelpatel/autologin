# IITB Internet Auto-Login

This extension allows the user to log in to internet.iitb.ac.in relatively effortlessly.

## Install & Usage

A browser-icon is created, clicking on which opens up a new tab and logs in to internet.iitb.ac.in. The user can also go to the site from the address bar and the extension automatically logs the user in. 

Download the repository and extract it. Now open up "script.js" in the extracted folder and change "your_username_here" to your LDAP ID and "your_password_here" to your password.

Now follow these steps:

1. Open Google Chrome.
2. Type the url "chrome://extensions" in the address bar.
3. Turn on the "Developer mode" toggle switch which is located on the top right corner of the window.
4. Click the "Load unpacked" button near the top left (below the "Extensions" heading).
5. Now selected the folder you extracted before and made changes to and upload it.
6. Voila! The extension is up and running!

PS: _This extension functions only for IIT Bombay internal networks._
